#Using Scripts

Scripts must to be used standalone, you only can use one at the same time, although some could be used "combined" in the same script.

All scripts must be renamed to "autoexec.ash" and copied to SD Card Root.

Scripts are executed by Ambarella RTOS Shell in boot time, not Linux Shell.
