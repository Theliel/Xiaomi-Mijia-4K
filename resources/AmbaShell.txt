#Ambarella Shell

Our Camera use a "dual" system: Linux and a RTOS OS. Linux provide all communication stuff, resources and others, while RTOS control is used for Camera control, UI...

We can interact with Linux Shell thank to Telnet, but at first time, we only "interact" with RTOS through RTOS protocol, being RTOS "invisible" to us.

Our Linux System only can interact directly with RTOS with the simple commandline tool: SendToRTOS & RecvFromRTOS, but both tools are very limited, are only used like flags:

SendToRTOS
usage: SendToRTOS <event type> [further info]
<event type>:
   "boot_done": Linux boot done.
   "net_ready" <type> <: network ready as specified type.
       <type>:
           0: AP mode.
           1: STA mode.
           2: P2P mode.
   "net_off": network turned-off.
   "photo": Capture photo with bluetooth shutter.
   "record": Record with bluetooth shutter.

RecvFromRTOS --help
usage: RecvFromRTOS [-f]
Paramters:
         "-f": same as "en_fg", to run at fore-ground.
         

The only feasible option is using autoexec.ash scripts.

In bootime, RTOS is able to execute all commands inside autoexec.ash file, in SD root. That commands, are not Linux commands, are Ambarella Shell commands, so is the only real/feasible option to execute some task, like custom scripts and some others tricks.

Ambarella Shell Commands are very limmited in Mijia. Is impossible to list all of them, but this list are most important shell commands:
(Note: ambash.sh is a custom tool, is not available in our system
